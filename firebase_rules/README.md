A type-safe Firebase rules generator for Firestore, Storage, and Realtime Database

## Super Early Bird Special
- Is this package production ready: no
- What works: the example
- What doesn't work: probably everything else
- Where is the documentation: nowhere

If you want to try it anyways, great! Please let me know what's broken.
